# Ascii-RPG-Battle

## Overview
This program is a turn-based RPG battle system in the ASCII art style.

It was created for my final project in Object-Oriented Programming class.


## Details
The player can create up to 4 different save files. 
After starting a new game, they will encounter 10 monsters in a row, being able to purchase items and train spells in between each fight. 

During each fight, the player takes turns choosing to Attack, use Magic, Block, or Berserk. 
They may also use Items or check Stats without using their turn.
Blocking makes the player take less damage, but also deal less damage.
Berserking is the opposite, making the player deal more damage, but also take more damage.

After choosing an attack for their turn, the player and monster will deal damage to each other based on their chosen attack. 
Whomever of the two which is fastest will attack first.

The fight ends if either the player or monster runs out of health points (HP).
If the monster is defeated, the player moves on to the next fight. 
Otherwise, if the player is defeated, they repeat the battle.

### Controls
The player may use the arrow keys/WASD to move the cursor, Z/J for selection, and X/K for cancel.
